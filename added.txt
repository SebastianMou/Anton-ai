## Project Features

I have successfully recreated the task management features without the use of AI. The project now includes:

- **Full CRUD functionality** for tasks and subtasks.
- Ability to manage **subtasks** with CRUD operations.
- Option to **check/uncheck** the completion status of both main tasks and subtasks.
- Working on **drag-and-drop functionality** for task reordering using Sortable.js.

### Current Issue:
- **New tasks** are currently rendering at the bottom of the task list, while I want them to render at the top.
- When tasks are set to render on top, the **drag-and-drop functionality** behaves unexpectedly, with positions getting mixed up. I'm actively working on resolving this issue.
